* An Emacs configuration.
** Installation
   To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d, i.e. ensure that the init.el
   contained in this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git clone https://github.com/matthiascy/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC

** Important note about *ido*
   This config enables *ido-mode* completion in the minibuffer wherever possible,
   which might confuse you when trying to open files using *C-x C-f*, e.g. when
   you want to open a directory to use dired -- if you get stuck, use *C-f* to
   drop into the regular *find-file* prompt. (You might want to customize the
   *ido-show-dot-for-dired* variable if this is an issue for you.)
